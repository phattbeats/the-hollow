# Phase P16: Standards codification into CLAUDE.md (component / token / a11y / perf / browser contracts)

Write the now-PROVEN frontend contracts (component, token, a11y, perf, browser, bundle) into the
relevant `CLAUDE.md` files, each pointing at the real guard test that enforces it. This is a
DOCS-ONLY phase: no product code moves. Because this is a 100% AI-authored codebase, codifying the
contracts the packet actually built is the leverage multiplier, every future AI-authored feature
then inherits them by default.

## Starter Prompt

```
This is Phase P16 of the Frontend Modernization v0.16.0 packet: Standards codification into CLAUDE.md.

Model: Opus 4.8, xhigh effort. Harness: Claude Code.

Worktree: /Users/fernando/Documents/wocc-v0.16.0 (branch feature/frontend-modernization-v016, off release/v0.16.0).

ULTRACODE: no. This is a small DOCS-ONLY phase (a handful of CLAUDE.md edits). Do it sequentially with one verification subagent at the end; do not fan out, there is nothing parallelizable and the risk is documenting a rule the code does not enforce, which a single careful pass plus an adversarial check catches better than fan-out.

Goal: codify the contracts P0-P15b actually built into the CLAUDE.md files that future AI authors read, with each documented contract naming its enforcing guard/test. The audience is the NEXT AI feature author: the codified rules must be the ones the code really enforces, never aspirational. Edit (and where missing, create) the relevant CLAUDE.md files; add a short "Authoring a new HUD component" recipe; cross-link the files so a reader lands on the right one. DOCS-ONLY: do NOT touch any product code, test, or generated file.

STEP 0 - PRE-FLIGHT:
- `git status` must be clean. This worktree is a shared checkout; if it is dirty, STOP and ask the user before touching anything.
- Confirm you are in /Users/fernando/Documents/wocc-v0.16.0 on branch feature/frontend-modernization-v016.
- GUARD-LANDED GATE (faithfulness precondition): before codifying ANY contract, confirm the phase that owns its guard actually landed it. P16 codifies only what P0-P15b shipped. Read progress.md and confirm these are marked done with their guard present on disk: P0 (css_corpus + the UI-purity guard + perf/visual/mobile baselines), P5 (ui_effects_profile resolver + the EFFECTS_QUALITY_LOW_CUTOFF cutoff), P6 (PainterHost two facets), P7a-P9b (cold windows), P10a-P14b (per-frame + tiering, incl the no-magic-values painter guard P12 named and the standing perf budget seeded by P10a), P15a-P15b (the WCAG 2.2 AA chrome a11y infra + axe/keyboard/forced-colors gates). If a phase that owns a guard is NOT yet done, STOP: do not codify a rule whose guard has not landed (record it as a still-pending gap and surface it). The bundle-budget CI gate and the cross-engine WebKit-in-CI wiring are KNOWN to be pending until P17b: codify them as pending-P17b, never as already-enforcing.
- Memory scan: read MEMORY.md plus the instruction-files policy entry [[instruction-files-policy]] (CLAUDE.md is the canonical Opus-4.8-targeted instruction file with a Sonnet baseline; i18n detail lives in src/ui), and [[ai-architecture-opus48-overhaul]] (module-first doctrine + the tests/architecture.test.ts sim/UI purity guard). Also no-em-dashes-or-emojis and shared-worktree-commit-care.

STEP 1 - LOAD CONTEXT:
Spawn ONE Explore agent to read + summarize back (the orchestrator keeps the summary, not raw dumps):
- docs/frontend-modernization/state.md: the locked decisions 9-14 (the COMPONENT CONTRACT incl the parameterized unit_frame FAMILY + multi-bar action bar; WCAG 2.2 AA chrome; theming dark-only + forced-colors; no-magic-values-in-painters; bundle discipline; browser matrix), the validation matrix (the WINDOW/CONTROL a11y row + the BUNDLE row + the PER-FRAME perf row), and the non-negotiable constraints block.
- docs/frontend-modernization/progress.md: the rows for P0 (the guards), P5 (ui_effects_profile), P6 (PainterHost), P7a-P9b (cold windows), P10a-P14b (per-frame + tiering, incl the P10a perf-budget seed and the P12 no-magic-values guard), P15a-P15b (a11y infra + audit) so you cite what those phases actually LANDED, not what they planned. The phase ids are the 30-phase post-restructure set (sub-letter splits); cite the real row that landed each guard.
- docs/frontend-modernization/v016-recon-and-packet.md: the "Load-bearing structural findings" + "Reuse from FB" sections (so the codified wording matches the real seam names: hotWriteCache, PainterHost, UI_PURE_CORES, the perf_tour harness).
- This phase file in full.
- The actual artifacts to cite (read the SHAPE/anchors only, do not rewrite them):
  - tests/architecture.test.ts: the UI-purity guard (forbiddenUiCoreImport + the UI_PURE_CORES allowlist) and the no-magic-values painter guard, whichever names P0/P5/P12 gave them.
  - tests/css_corpus.test.ts (the CSS completeness guard), tests/client_shell.test.ts (the moved-DOM-id grep), tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts and scripts/perf_tour.mjs (the perf gate: frameP95 + hudHotDomSkipRate + allocation/bounded-node assertions), and whatever P15 added for axe-core/keyboard/forced-colors and P17-pending bundle-budget (note which gate is LANDED vs deferred to P17).
  - src/ui/painter_host.ts (the PainterHost seam surface), src/ui/ui_effects_profile.ts (the static-preset resolver), src/ui/theme.ts (runtime --color-* applier), and one unit_frame family core + painter (the parameterized FAMILY proof) so the recipe and the component-contract wording match the real signatures.
  - The CLAUDE.md files to edit: the root CLAUDE.md (its Repo map table at ~16-26 has rows for src/sim, src/render, src/ui, etc but NO src/styles row; add one), src/ui/CLAUDE.md (it already has a "## UI/UX, mobile & accessibility standards" section at ~22 and an "### Extracting a HUD window (the recipe)" at ~88 to EXTEND, not duplicate; its a11y line ~45 currently says "WCAG 2.1 AA" and its target-size line ~43 currently says ">=40x40px"), and src/styles/CLAUDE.md (CREATE if absent; src/styles/ is new this packet). Check for any new component-dir barrel (e.g. a src/ui/components/ or unit_frame dir) that earned its own CLAUDE.md per the repo's "directory with an index.ts barrel + local CLAUDE.md" rule.

STEP 2 - CHOOSE ORCHESTRATION + EXECUTE (sequential, no fan-out):
Make the documentation edits. The six contracts to codify, each with a pointer to its REAL enforcing guard/test:

0. REPO MAP (root CLAUDE.md, the Repo map table at ~16-26): add a `src/styles/` row, e.g. "| `src/styles/` | Extracted HUD CSS (tokens/base/layout/components/hud/hud.mobile + per-entry .extra) behind the `@layer` order; imported once from the game entries. See `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`. |". This is the single product-tree pointer the table is currently missing now that the CSS lives in its own directory.

1. COMPONENT CONTRACT (root CLAUDE.md "Modularity" section + src/ui/CLAUDE.md):
   - Pure view-core (DOM/Three-free, Node-tested, allocation-light if hot) + thin write-elided painter + INSTANCE-PARAMETERIZED (no hardcoded element ids, no single-instance assumptions).
   - The reusable FAMILIES the packet built: ONE unit_frame core+painter reused across player/target/party (ready for focus/raid/boss); the action bar instance-parameterized so a second/third bar is `new ActionBarPainter(barDescriptor)`. State that ADDING the extra bars/raid frames is a follow-on FEATURE that inherits the seam, not part of the refactor (do not over-claim).
   - The PainterHost seam (src/ui/painter_host.ts): the thin shared dep-bag (icon/money/tooltip helpers + Hud's elided writers) painters compose into.
   - Enforced by: the UI-purity guard in tests/architecture.test.ts (forbiddenUiCoreImport + UI_PURE_CORES) - a registered core may not import three, a *_painter, painter_host, or DOM globals.

2. TOKEN SYSTEM (src/styles/CLAUDE.md, CREATE; cross-linked from root + src/ui):
   - Tiered tokens + the single @layer order; the src/styles module shape (tokens/base/layout/components/hud/hud.mobile + per-entry .extra) as P1-P4 landed it.
   - NO magic values in painters: painters drive CSS custom properties / tokens, never a literal hex/px/color in TS; thresholds + cadences (the 100/250/500ms frame-divider, breakpoints) are named constants.
   - theme.ts runtime --color-* accent theming (the ONE dark aesthetic; no light/prefers-color-scheme theme).
   - Enforced by: the no-magic-values painter guard in tests/architecture.test.ts (name it exactly as P12 named it) + tests/css_corpus.test.ts (the section-by-section CSS completeness guard).

3. A11Y baseline (src/ui/CLAUDE.md "UI/UX, mobile & accessibility standards", EXTEND/RECONCILE the existing section):
   - RECONCILE the existing standard, do NOT silently weaken it. The current section says "WCAG 2.1 AA" (line ~45) and a touch-target line ">=40x40px" (line ~43). This packet built to WCAG 2.2 AA, so BUMP the standard line to "WCAG 2.2 AA". But the existing >=40x40px touch floor is STRONGER than the new SC 2.5.8 24px minimum, so KEEP 40x40px as the PREFERRED touch-control floor and add 24px only as the absolute minimum (SC 2.5.8). Write it so a reader cannot read this as a relaxation: "mobile touch controls remain >=40x40px (the preferred floor); 24x24px (SC 2.5.8) is the absolute minimum, used only where 40x40 is genuinely infeasible." Do NOT replace 40x40 with 24px.
   - The WCAG 2.2 AA chrome checklist as P15a/P15b actually implemented it: semantic roles + aria, focus management (trap + return on window open/close), visible :focus-visible never animated away, skip links, live regions for chat + combat text, target-size minimums (SC 2.5.8, the 40x40-preferred / 24px-absolute floor above), forced-colors: active support (borders/focus survive, meaning never carried by background-image alone). Also note the dropped `user-scalable=no` / `maximum-scale=1.0` viewport lock (SC 1.4.4 / 1.4.10) with the 16px input-font floor as the anti-zoom guard, since that is now the shipped reality (decision 10).
   - The SCOPE BOUNDARY stated honestly: the HUD chrome (windows/buttons/forms/menus/chat/tooltips) is in scope; the 3D world/canvas is OUT of scope (not screen-readable).
   - Enforced by: the axe-core (or equivalent) + keyboard-reachability + forced-colors gates P15a/P15b landed (name the real test files).

4. PERF gate (src/ui/CLAUDE.md + cross-link from root):
   - Write-elision: hotWriteCache + setText/setDisplay/setTransform/setWidth (hud.ts:1322-1372); per-frame painter writes go ONLY through the host's elided writers, cache keys byte-identical.
   - The per-frame core is allocation-light (no per-frame garbage).
   - The perf_tour baseline + the standing gate: frameP95 <= baseline AND hudHotDomSkipRate >= baseline (+ the P12 allocation-budget and P13 bounded-node assertions).
   - The two-controller rule: HUD tier knobs read the STATIC graphicsPresetLabel via ui_effects_profile, NEVER governor.state().levels (the ui gfx bucket stays governable:false).
   - GAMEPLAY-NEUTRAL GRAPHICS (codify this in the ROOT CLAUDE.md "Invariants, YOU MUST keep these" section, NOT only the perf section: it is a core game-fairness rule that sits beside server-authority and determinism, and it generalizes the two-controller rule above). No graphics or performance preset may give a player a gameplay ADVANTAGE or DISADVANTAGE. A tier may shed COSMETIC richness (FCT volume/lifetime, minimap redraw smoothness, buff-icon overflow, portrait/HP-bar redraw smoothness within about 200ms), but NEVER actionable information a player reads and reacts to: own debuffs, party/raid member HP, the target/boss cast bar, target HP granularity, enemy/aggro positions. The test for a new tier knob: if it hides or delays something a player acts on, it is not allowed. Cross-reference docs/design/graphics-settings-fairness.md (the per-knob analysis + the P14a fairness re-audit) from the root invariant line. Enforced TODAY by: the debuff-priority aura cap (tests/auras_painter.test.ts: a debuff past the buff cap still renders), party frames left un-tiered (tests/ui_tier_knobs.test.ts party-not-tiered source-scan), and the static-preset wiring scan (tests/ui_tier_knobs.test.ts Hud.fxTier source-scan + the import-absence/behavioral two-controller assertion). KNOWN OPEN GAP, document as PENDING (faithfulness: do NOT codify this invariant as airtight): a negative-value buff_* stat-sap aura reads as a buff ONLINE because the wire zeroes aura.value (server/game.ts WireAura omits value; src/net/online.ts decodes value: 0), so online on the low preset it can ride the buff cap; tracked with a ready remediation prompt in docs/design/graphics-settings-fairness.md. State the invariant AND that this one wire-parity case is not yet closed.
   - Enforced by: tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts (the STANDING budget; it becomes a standing gate in P17a, where the first all-together perf run lands) + scripts/perf_tour.mjs (the perf gate) + the import-absence/behavioral assertion P14a used for the two-controller rule. Note the per-frame phases TAG their green-perf-gate commit so a later cumulative regression bisects to a phase.

5. BROWSER matrix (src/styles/CLAUDE.md or root, whichever the .browserslistrc lives nearest):
   - Big-3 desktop PLUS mobile Safari/WebKit as a first-class target; a forced-colors pass; a MINIMAL @media print reset (hide the canvas, a full-screen game has no print layout).
   - Enforced by: the .browserslistrc floor (LANDED in P1) + the cross-engine E2E. The WebKit-in-CI wiring lands in P17b, so document it as "pending P17b" to match reality: the .browserslistrc floor is enforced today, but do NOT claim CI WebKit is wired if P17b has not run when you write this. State plainly which half is live and which is pending-P17b.

6. BUNDLE discipline (src/styles/CLAUDE.md or root):
   - The JS bundle-budget CI gate (sibling to asset:budget); the SELECTIVE lazy-load policy (measure cold-window cost first, then dynamic-import only the genuinely heavy + rarely-opened windows; keep frequently-opened ones eager). Evidence-driven, never blanket splitting.
   - Enforced by: the bundle-budget gate. This is PENDING P17b (the actual CI gate, the selective lazy-load, and the cross-engine E2E all land in P17b). At P16 codification time the bundle policy is DOCUMENTED only, with no CI gate yet enforcing it: write it as "pending P17b", never as an enforced gate. Document only what is true at codification time.

7. "Authoring a new HUD component" RECIPE (src/ui/CLAUDE.md, fold into / replace the existing "### Extracting a HUD window (the recipe)" so there is ONE recipe, not two):
   The ordered steps a future feature follows:
   (a) Write the pure view-core in src/ui/<name>_view.ts: map IWorld -> a render model; instance-parameterized (take a descriptor/id, no hardcoded element id). Register it in the UI_PURE_CORES allowlist in tests/architecture.test.ts.
   (b) Add tests/<name>_view.test.ts: same-input-same-output; no Math.random/Date.now/performance.now; no DOM import.
   (c) Write the thin painter on the PainterHost seam: all DOM writes through the elided writers; drive tokens/vars, no literal hex/px (the no-magic-values guard).
   (d) For chrome (a window/control): satisfy the WCAG 2.2 AA checklist (roles/aria/focus-return/:focus-visible/target-size/forced-colors).
   (e) For a hot (per-frame) component: allocation-light core, the perf gate (frameP95 + skip-rate), tier knobs read the static preset not the governor.
   (f) Reuse a FAMILY before building bespoke: a unit-style frame is a unit_frame instance; an extra action bar is a new ActionBarPainter(descriptor).
   (g) Run the matching validation-matrix rows (state.md) before committing.

Cross-link every edited CLAUDE.md to the others (root -> src/ui + src/styles for the frontend contracts; src/ui <-> src/styles). Keep each addition concise and pointer-heavy; do not restate the whole packet, point at state.md and the guard tests.

INVARIANTS THIS PHASE MUST KEEP (from state.md locked decisions + non-negotiable constraints):
- DOCS-ONLY. Edit ONLY CLAUDE.md files (and create src/styles/CLAUDE.md + any earned component-dir CLAUDE.md). Do NOT touch any .ts/.css/.html/test/generated file. If codifying a rule reveals the code does not actually enforce it, do NOT add product code to make it true here; record it as a deferral/gap and surface it (a contract is only codified if a guard already enforces it).
- FAITHFUL, not aspirational: every documented contract names a guard/test that REALLY exists and enforces it as written. If a gate is deferred to P17b (WebKit-in-CI, bundle-budget CI), say so plainly; do not document it as already-enforcing.
- Do not duplicate: EXTEND the existing src/ui/CLAUDE.md a11y section and FOLD the existing window-extraction recipe into the new recipe; do not leave two competing recipes or two a11y lists.
- Respect the instruction-files policy: CLAUDE.md is the canonical Opus-4.8-targeted file with a Sonnet baseline; keep i18n detail in src/ui (do not move it). Match each file's existing voice and section style.
- No em dashes, en dashes, or emojis in any text you ADD. NOTE: these CLAUDE.md files already contain unicode (the existing src/ui/CLAUDE.md a11y lines use the U+2265 ">=" glyph and the U+00D7 "x" in "40x40px"); the no-dash/ASCII rule applies to your NEW text only. When you reword an existing line (the a11y standard bump, the target-size reconcile), prefer ASCII (">=", "x") in the replacement, but do not go hunting to rewrite untouched unicode lines, and never introduce an em/en dash or emoji.
- Shared worktree: commit with EXPLICIT paths, never git add -A.

Out of scope (do NOT do in this phase):
- Any product-code change, new test, new guard, or generated-file edit. If a contract lacks a guard, this phase records the GAP; it does not write the guard (that would be a code phase, not codification).
- The harness re-author + standing perf budget + the first all-together perf run -> P17a (phase-17a-harness-floor.md). The bundle-budget CI gate + selective lazy-load + cross-engine E2E wiring + axe-in-CI -> P17b (phase-17b-bundle-close.md). This phase only DOCUMENTS those (as pending the named phase); it does not wire them.
- The accessibility implementation itself -> P15a (infra) + P15b (audit). This phase documents the a11y baseline P15a/P15b built; it does not add a11y behavior.
- i18n catalog/locale edits; sim/server/net/headless; CSS/HTML entries.

STEP 3 - VALIDATION + REVIEW:
This is docs-only, so per the validation matrix the CODE rows do NOT apply. Run only:
- A markdown sanity pass on the NEW text: no em/en dashes or emojis in anything you added (grep the diff hunks, not the whole pre-existing file, which already carries unicode), all cross-links resolve to real files, every cited guard/test path exists (test the paths with a quick ls).
- Confirm NO PRODUCT CODE is in the diff: `git status` shows ONLY CLAUDE.md files (root + src/ui + the new src/styles + any earned component-dir) AND the packet progress/state docs (docs/frontend-modernization/progress.md, docs/frontend-modernization/state.md). The Step 6 progress.md/state.md ledger commits are EXPECTED and allowed; what must be absent is any .ts/.css/.html/test/generated file. If a non-CLAUDE.md, non-packet-doc file appears in the diff, STOP.
Review dispatch (state.md Review Dispatch Matrix): this is docs/CLAUDE.md-only, which matches NO review row (no server/net/admin, no IWorld/sim/wire, no DDL), so spawn NO standing reviewer. INSTEAD spawn ONE fresh subagent for the phase-specific acceptance check. Its job is FAITHFULNESS in BOTH directions, prompt it for COVERAGE not filtering:
  (a) NO OVER-CLAIM: for each documented contract, confirm the named guard/test exists and actually enforces the rule as written (read the guard, not just its filename); flag any rule documented as enforced that the code does NOT enforce (the pending-P17b bundle + WebKit gates must read as pending, not enforced).
  (b) NO UNDER-CITE: flag any guard the packet SHIPPED (a P0-P15b test/gate that really enforces a frontend contract) that the codification left UNCITED, so a real, enforced rule is not silently omitted from the docs the next author reads. A shipped-but-undocumented guard is a coverage gap as much as an over-claimed one.
  Do not commit until it reports no rule is over-claimed AND no shipped guard is left uncited.

STEP 4 - COMMIT CADENCE (2-4 Conventional Commits, scope + EXPLICIT paths, never git add -A):
- docs(ui): codify component + a11y + perf contracts and authoring recipe (CLAUDE.md, src/ui/CLAUDE.md)
- docs(styles): add src/styles/CLAUDE.md (token system + browser matrix + bundle discipline) (src/styles/CLAUDE.md, plus any component-dir CLAUDE.md)
- docs(frontend): mark P16 complete in progress.md + state.md ledger (docs/frontend-modernization/progress.md, docs/frontend-modernization/state.md)

STEP 5 - ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: see the checklist below; every item green before the phase is done.

STEP 6 - DOC UPDATES + MEMORY:
Update progress.md (mark P16 done; list each CLAUDE.md touched/created and the contract it now codifies, plus the new root-CLAUDE.md src/styles Repo-map row and the src/ui a11y reconcile from WCAG 2.1 to 2.2 AA keeping the 40x40 floor) and the state.md ledger (P16 -> done; note that the six contracts are now codified, each pointing at its guard, and that the bundle-budget + cross-engine WebKit CI gates remain pending P17b). Record in memory the surprising finding if any (e.g. a contract that turned out to have NO enforcing guard and was recorded as a gap rather than codified as enforced, or a shipped guard the docs had to be expanded to cite).

STEP 7 - FINAL RESPONSE: report status, the CLAUDE.md files edited/created (absolute paths), the validation results (markdown sanity + faithfulness-reviewer verdict, both over-claim AND under-cite), any contract recorded as a GAP (documented-but-not-yet-enforced, deferred to a code phase) and any guard the reviewer flagged as shipped-but-uncited that you then added, and end with exactly:
Next: phase-17a-harness-floor.md

STOPPING RULES (phase-specific):
- STOP and record a GAP (do not invent a guard) if a contract you are about to codify has NO existing enforcing guard/test: document it as a known gap with the phase that should add the guard, never as an enforced rule. The bundle-budget + cross-engine WebKit gates are KNOWN-pending P17b: codify them as pending, not as a gap to be fixed here.
- STOP at the STEP 0 guard-landed gate if a phase that owns a guard you are about to codify (P0-P15b) is not yet marked done with its guard present: codifying a rule whose guard has not landed is over-claiming. Record it as still-pending and surface it.
- STOP and ask the user if codifying a contract would require editing any product-code file (.ts/.css/.html/test/generated): this phase is docs-only by definition (the Step 6 progress.md/state.md ledger commits are the ONLY non-CLAUDE.md edits allowed); a product-code change means the prior phase did not finish.
- STOP if the existing src/ui/CLAUDE.md a11y section or window-extraction recipe conflicts with what P15a/P15b/P6-P9b actually built: reconcile to the SHIPPED reality (the code is the source of truth), do not preserve a stale doc rule. The one explicit reconcile is the WCAG 2.1 -> 2.2 AA bump while KEEPING the >=40x40px touch floor (24px is only the absolute SC 2.5.8 minimum); do not weaken the stronger floor.
- STOP if any cited guard/test path does not exist: fix the citation (or downgrade the contract to a gap), never cite a guard that is not there.
- STOP and ADD a citation if the faithfulness reviewer flags a shipped P0-P15b guard the docs left uncited: an enforced rule omitted from the docs is a coverage gap, fix it before committing.
```

## Notes for the planner

P16 is deliberately a low-risk docs-only phase placed AFTER the implementation (deps P0-P15b) because
a contract is only worth codifying once a guard test actually enforces it: the whole value is that a
100% AI-authored codebase inherits the proven rules by default, so documenting an aspirational rule
the code does not enforce would actively mislead the next author. The real hazard is two-sided,
over-claiming (a rule with no guard) AND under-citing (a shipped guard the docs omit), which is why
the only review for this phase is a faithfulness subagent that reads each named guard and confirms it
enforces the documented rule, and also sweeps for any shipped P0-P15b guard the docs left out, not a
standing code reviewer (no code surface is touched, so the Review Dispatch Matrix matches no row). A
STEP 0 guard-landed gate makes the same point at the front: do not codify a rule whose owning phase
has not landed its guard. The phase EXTENDS and RECONCILES the already-present src/ui/CLAUDE.md a11y
section (~22): it bumps WCAG 2.1 AA to 2.2 AA but KEEPS the existing >=40x40px touch floor (24px is
only the SC 2.5.8 absolute minimum) so the stronger floor is never silently weakened, and it FOLDS the
existing window-extraction recipe (~88) into the one authoring recipe rather than adding parallel
copies. It CREATES src/styles/CLAUDE.md because src/styles/ is new this packet (P1-P4b) and adds the
missing src/styles row to the root Repo map table. The bundle-budget CI gate and the cross-engine
WebKit-in-CI wiring both land in P17b, so the phase documents those as pending-P17b, not as
already-enforcing; the standing perf budget becomes a standing gate in P17a. Because docs-only ALSO
includes the Step 6 progress.md/state.md ledger commits, STEP 3 checks for no PRODUCT code rather than
only-CLAUDE.md, so the ledger commits are allowed. The no-em-dash/ASCII rule is scoped to NEW text
because these files already carry unicode (>= and x glyphs). The stopping rules make recording a gap,
never inventing a guard, the safe default. See state.md for the locked decisions, the validation
matrix, and the workflow; this phase does not re-derive them.
