# FORK-NOTES

The fork-discipline log mandated by the constitution (`docs/plan-the-hollow.md`, §6).
Every modification to this fork gets a dated entry below. Upstream is a
**one-time donor**: no tracking, no routine merges, ever. A specific upstream
fix may be cherry-picked by hand, with an entry here.

## Sync point

- **Upstream:** `levy-street/world-of-claudecraft`
- **Pinned commit:** `b00fb6a5d6d0e1ffab9327ddcbfeb730267ab05e` (upstream tag `v0.17.0`, 2,703 commits)
- **Local tag:** `upstream-sync-2026-06-30`
- **Inherited test suite verified green, unmodified** (2026-07-01): 569 test
  files, 5,997 tests passed, 0 real failures. Eight tests hit the 5-second
  default timeout on slow container hardware and all pass unmodified with
  `--testTimeout` raised; they are environment flakes, not failures.

## Staged content (applied at fork time, per the §6 mandate; not a gameplay modification)

- `src/sim/content/hollow.ts`: the Hollow zone module from the packet
  (Greenpaw, the first-run quests, the Under-Shrine skeleton). **Not yet
  registered** in `sim/data.ts`; registration is Phase 1 work.
- `docs/plan-the-hollow.md`: the constitution (v3.1), the game's governing document.
- `docs/sim/hollow-build-sim-v2.py`, `docs/sim/hollow-build-sim-v2-results.txt`:
  the section 8 build-depth simulation and its corrected first results.

## Modifications

### 2026-07-01: Wallet strip (constitution, section 6)

Removed the $WOC token / Reown / WalletConnect stack in full:

- **Server:** `server/wallet.ts`, `server/wallet_link.ts`, `server/woc_balance.ts`,
  plus their wiring in `server/main.ts`, `server/game.ts`, `server/db.ts`,
  `server/internal.ts`, `server/ratelimit.ts`, `server/discord.ts`, `server/discord_db.ts`.
- **Sim:** `src/sim/holder_tier.ts`, `src/sim/discord_tier.ts` (holdings- and
  boost-gated tier logic).
- **Client / UI:** `src/net/wallet.ts`, `src/ui/wallet_balance.ts`,
  `src/ui/holder_tier.ts`, `src/ui/discord_tier.ts`, plus references across the
  HUD, options, player card, bags window, account portal, settings, and the
  entry HTML.
- **Docs / assets:** the whitepaper PDF (and its landing-page footer link), the
  wallet PRDs (`docs/prd/woc/wallet-link.md`,
  `docs/prd/woc/holder-cosmetic-flair.md`), `scripts/wallet_e2e.mjs`, and the
  Reown / WalletConnect third-party licenses.
- **Landing page:** the $WOC contract-address block (`#token-ca` in
  `index.html`), its click-to-copy wiring in `src/main.ts`, and its CSS across
  `shell.css` / `hud.css` / `hud.mobile.css`.
- **Nameplates:** the holder-tier badge (painter, renderer DOM plumbing,
  `np-tier` CSS) and the dead `holderTier` / `holderBalance` entity fields,
  their wire mappings, and their parity-exclude entries.
- **Tests:** every wallet / holder-tier / discord-tier suite removed with its
  feature; surviving suites (security rate limits, settings, options, account
  portal, companion API gates, client shell, discord bot / server / widget)
  trimmed to the post-strip surface.

Keeps, per the mandate: the Discord bridge (`bot/`, `server/discord_oauth.ts`,
the relay, PFP / nickname / member-since / staff-role flair) stays; the old
`statusTier` / `dt` wire field now carries only a 0/1 linked flag. The bot no
longer requests the GUILD_MESSAGES intent (it existed for the removed points
ladder). Arena code stays dormant, its UI unbuilt, since it shares a file with
duels.

Known-inert leftovers (strings only, no live code path): the `wallet.*` i18n
catalog block and its locale overlays, and the admin `usage.metric.wallet*`
label keys. No `t('wallet...')` callers remain; deleting them is a
locale-hygiene chore across 20 overlay files, deferred out of the strip commit.

Verification: `tsc --noEmit` clean and the full Vitest suite green after the
strip (recorded in the commit for this entry). Note for future verifiers: run
the suite with NODE_ENV unset. This container exports NODE_ENV=production,
which makes Vitest report `import.meta.env.PROD = true` and flips the i18n
runtime into release semantics, failing five i18n / OG tests that are green
under a normal test environment.

## 2026-07-02: realm picker stat corrected to live online count (PR #9)

Upstream's landing-page realm picker shows lifetime accounts created labeled
just "Players" beneath the green Online dot, which reads as a live player
count (reported by the Board with 2 accounts and 0 players online). The
picker now binds to `players_online` from the same `/api/project-stats`
payload and uses the existing `stats.playersOnline` label. Files:
`index.html`, `play.html`, `src/main.ts` (`loadProjectStats`). Redeployed to
PHATT-RAID (image `eastbrook-game:phase0` rebuilt, container recreated with
`PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://thehollow.phatt.vip`, previously theplant.phatt.vip).
