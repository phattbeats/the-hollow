// World bosses (PHAA-494): server-wide elites that rise on a fixed cadence, announce
// themselves, and reward every player who damaged them with PERSONAL loot, gated to
// once per lockout window per boss. Ported from upstream's v0.20/v0.21 world-boss
// framework (Thunzharr, the Waking Peak) and re-derived into this fork's idioms; see
// the Heartwood Colossus entry in content/hollow_zone.ts for the Plant World reskin.
//
// This module owns the world-boss DATA (the spawn registry) and the pure pieces of
// the system: the per-player loot lockout, the contributor set derived from a boss's
// hate table, and the personal-loot roller. The SCHEDULER state and the spawn
// primitive live on `Sim` (it needs createMob/addEntity/groundPos), which drives this
// module each tick; the loot roller is reached through the SimContext seam
// (ctx.rollWorldBossLoot), exactly like ctx.rollLoot.
//
// Fork divergence from upstream (documented, not a bug): upstream gates the loot
// lockout with a host-injected `ctx.raidResetMs(nowMs)` (a "next daily/weekly reset
// boundary" callback) that this fork never adopted; our raid-lockout system
// (PlayerMeta.raidLockouts) instead follows the existing fixed-duration-add pattern
// already used by encounters/nythraxis.ts's grantNythraxisLockout (`ctx.lockoutNowMs()
// + a constant`). WORLD_BOSS_LOCKOUT_MS below is that constant (24h, matching the
// ticket's "daily personal-loot lockout" framing); markWorldBossLooted adds it to the
// host lockout clock directly instead of calling a raidResetMs callback that does not
// exist in this fork.
//
// Determinism (this is sim-core): no Math.random/Date.now, randomness is ctx.rng
// only. The personal-loot roller draws rng in a FIXED order (contributors sorted by
// entityId, loot entries in array order) so the parity gate's rng draw-order log
// stays stable.
