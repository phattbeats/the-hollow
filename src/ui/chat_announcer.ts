// Chat live-region announcer (WIRING, not a registered pure core): the chat sibling of
// ./combat_announcer. It buffers the chat lines that reach the visible #chatlog pane and
// flushes a single off-screen polite summary into the tab-independent #chat-live region at
// most once per CHAT_ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL_MS, so a chat burst never floods the screen reader.
// Like CombatAnnouncer it is DOM-free by construction (the text sink and the clock are
// injected) so a Vitest drives it without jsdom; hud.ts wires the sink to the #chat-live
// element's textContent and the clock to performance.now.
//
// WHY A DEDICATED REGION (P18d items 3 + 5): chat's live region used to ride #chatlog
// itself, but #chatlog goes display:none whenever the combat tab is active, and a
// display:none live region is silent, so chat was not announced on the combat tab.
// #chat-live is a separate top-of-HUD off-screen region that is ALWAYS in the layout, so
// chat announces regardless of which chat tab is shown; #chatlog is set aria-live="off" so
// it no longer double-announces alongside #chat-live (role="log" implies an implicit
// polite, which the explicit off overrides).
//
// The per-type politeness decision lives in the pure ./live_region_politeness picker; this
// module owns only the buffer + throttle state. It shares that picker's pure
// combatAnnounceDue gate, which is parameterized by the injected interval (a host/kind
// agnostic time comparison), so chat reuses it rather than re-spelling the cadence math. It
// announces the latest chat line per interval (a burst collapses to the most recent), and
// never re-localizes: the line it relays is the already-rendered chat text built at the
// append site, so no new player-visible text is introduced here.
